We have proposed a multi-label classification model created using the ensemble method to improve predictive accuracy. The classification is multi-label due to the fact that a person suffering from one mental health condition is likely to suffer from others as well. Our models are trained on a survey dataset, where users diagnosed with a variety of mental health conditions answer questions regarding their social media usage and its impact on their mental well-being.
Later, we developed a web application where users can acquire possible diagnoses about their own mental health concerns by answering a simple questionnaire.
